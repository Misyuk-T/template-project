# Next.js TypeScript Template with Chakra UI

This is a starter template for Next.js projects with TypeScript and Chakra UI pre-configured. It includes ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for linting and formatting, ensuring code consistency and quality.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Chakra UI**: Includes [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for building accessible and customizable React components.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Integrated with ESLint and Prettier to enforce code quality and formatting rules.
- **Husky & lint-staged**: Configured with Husky and lint-staged to run ESLint and Prettier on pre-commit, ensuring clean code in your commits.
- **Automatic Font Optimization**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
